    Create a socket.

    Construct the address structure for the serverâ€™s socket and connect to the socket at that address.

    Execute a loop that copies its standard input to the socket connection.
    Upon encountering end-of-file in its standard input,
    the client terminates, with the result that its socket is closed
    and the server sees end-of-file when reading from the socket on the other end of the connection.
